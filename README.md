# Google Cloud Practice Project
## Labs Completion
The screenshots I took from Qwiklabs hand-on-labs results are stored in 'screens' folder.
Even-though I did more than 10 hand-in-labs only a few of them were acknowledged and I received a reply.

## Translations
They are stored in 'translations' folder.
I completed the lab using only command line when possible for 2 labs :
 1 - Configuring an Internal Load Balancer.
 2 - AK8S-02 Working with Cloud Build.
